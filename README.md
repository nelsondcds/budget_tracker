# budget_tracker by Nelson Carlos Da Silva

This repository contains my submission for the Progressive Web Applications Challenge: Budget Tracker. The challenge consists of updating an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. Requirements included using IndexedDB to add offline functionality, adding a service worker to the application, and addig a web manifest to the application.
